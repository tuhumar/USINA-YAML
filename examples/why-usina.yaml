      Create a minimalist motion-graphics overlay: a YAML snippet in monospaced font,
      with subtle highlighting that steps through meta -> assets -> script -> timeline -> qa.
      Background transparent; soft drop-shadow; smooth cursor reveal; no logos.

    prompt: >
      Create a short UI animation: checklist items tick on (timeline ordered, no overlap, assets resolved),
      ending with a green 'LINT: PASS' badge. Clean, modern, non-branded.

    - id: "vo_scene_01_hook"
      text: >
        You’ve seen this horror movie: the script is in one doc, the assets are in five folders,
        the timeline lives in someone’s head, and the credits… are missing. Then launch day arrives,
        and everything breaks.
    - id: "vo_scene_02_definition"
      text: >
        USINA-YAML is a simple idea: a single YAML file that describes a short video end-to-end.
        Tool-agnostic, human-readable, and strict enough to be validated.
    - id: "vo_scene_03_whats_inside"
      text: >
        It contains the metadata, the style rules, the music, the variables, the prompts,
        every asset with license and credit, the full narration, and a timeline with exact seconds.
        One file becomes the source of truth.
    - id: "vo_scene_04_why_standardize"
      text: >
        Why does standardization matter? Because it makes work shareable and reproducible.
        When everyone speaks the same “spec language,” you can swap editors, automate pipelines,
        and catch mistakes early with lints: missing assets, overlapping scenes, broken IDs.
    - id: "vo_scene_05_community_value"
      text: >
        For a community, this is rocket fuel. Templates become remixable. Tools become compatible.
        People can build validators, converters, editors, and CI checks—without rewriting everything
        for each creator’s custom format.
    - id: "vo_scene_06_not_a_cage"
      text: >
        And no—this isn’t a creativity cage. It’s a contract. You still decide the story, the visuals,
        the jokes, the vibe. USINA-YAML just keeps the machinery honest.
    - id: "vo_scene_07_how_to_adopt"
      text: >
        Start small: adopt the schema header, list your assets with credits, define your timeline,
        and turn on QA rules. If you can read a recipe, you can read this.
    - id: "vo_scene_08_close"
      text: >
        USINA-YAML: one file, one truth, any tool. Standardize the boring parts—so the community
        can go wild on the creative ones.
